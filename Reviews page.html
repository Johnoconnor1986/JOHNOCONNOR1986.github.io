                    Limerick stalwarts of the Irish music scene, Fox Jaw, are back with their brand-new
                    album Breathe in the Strange. Their third studio album finds them in a new experimental
                    phase, New techniques are used, new sounds have been found, this is an album with
                    a larger, slightly more, cinematic feel.
                </p>

                    This isn’t your usual Fox Jaw album, and it’s all the better for it. It has been
                    over a decade since the formation of the band, and nearly six years since their last
                    album Ghost Parade. It is in that time their sound has changed in numerous ways;
                    this is a record that feels like a culmination of everything has that come before.
                    There is growth to the Fox Jaw sound, Though, it’s not all change at Fox Jaw HQ.
                    Tracks such as Madeline, Sun Goes Sideways, and Let it Run, find the band firmly
                    in their own brand of inimitable musical noir tinged swagger, with stories of femme
                    fatales and smokey rooms, that wouldn’t sound out of place in a Raymond Chandler
                    novella.

                    It is easy to see why these three tracks were used as the first singles.
                    They are catchy and easily digestible, reminiscent of recent tracks from their Black
                    Light Vignette Ep from 2016. The rest of the album finds the band at a more restrained
                    pace, with tracks Serrated Love, a slow and mournful rock song that is steeped in
                    heartbreak. Someone Like You, finds the band in moody rock n roll territory that has
                    become a mainstay in their work over the years. A track with slick guitar work,
                    gentle keys, all deftly mixed together giving the track a sense of drama. Following
                    this comes the album title track Breathe in the Strange, a sultry smooth song metered
                    out to perfection. These tracks take their time, they get under the skin.
                    They do what Fox Jaw do best, they tell stories.

                    It is the final track of the album Shadowland that shows the biggest change in the
                    band’s sound, a sprawling, eleven-and-a-half-minute epic that brings the talents
                    of every member of the band to the forefront, and in some respects it is quite
                    reminiscent of Ultra Vox’s Vienna. A slow atmospheric track that builds to a stadium
                    esque singalong, built over gunshot drums and vocalist Ronan Mitchells unmistakeable
                    timbre, it is a track that has proven to be an audience favourite of recent Fox Jaw
                    Live Shows. It is a beautiful and restrained third album that shows growth and
                    maturity in a band ready for big things
