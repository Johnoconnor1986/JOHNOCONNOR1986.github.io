                <h3>Hunting For Snares</h3>
                <p>
                    Mayos Hunting for Snare came out of a wild brains of Umrella records co-founders
                    Tomás Concannon (BuryMe with my Money), and Joseph Padfield (Bannered Mare).
                    Each one known for their creativity in recent years with their own bands whlst
                    also starting of umbrella records, a place that the guys can all come together
                    to produce content for their many artists under their ‘umbrella, see what they did
                    there. Artists that include the aforementioned Bannered Mare and Bury Me… but
                    also includes Oscar Mild, Derek Ellard, and now Hunting for Snares, it’s a place
                    where music and videos are all produced to great effect in house. hunting for
                    Snares is put forth as an experiment in audio visual wizardry, their goal being
                    to create a performance piece that uses both forms of media to bring back
                    the scope of live performance.

                <p>
                    After my first listen a few days back, I had two words slip out of my mouth.
                    “oh damn”, it conjured within me aspects of Radiohead, Aphex Twin and with some
                    degree of Burial vibes. It is a dark electro pop trip. Presented as a complete
                    17-and-a-half-minute audio visual project, it is one complete piece of work with
                    each track seamlessly melting into each other. Accompanied by a crazy trippy video
                    of visuals that bring to mind a drunken messed up night.
                    Visuals that were made by the boys themselves during what looks like a very fun day,
                    these need to be seen on a nice high def screen.
                <p>
                    I spoke to the both Joe and
                    Tomás earlier in the week about the new project.

                    Joseph Padfield.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What was the initial idea behind the Hunting for Snares project?
                </p>

                <p> Joe: ‘HFS was born out of over indulgence. We would always want to write when we
                    got messed up as you do. so we decided to intentionally get loose and write.
                    This is what came out. It's a dark and a lil off centre, much like ourselves’
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tomás: ‘I agree with everything Joe said and to add to that, HFS for me,
                    began when myself and Joe lived together in Galway town in 2016. There may have been
                    some drink taken on one night in question, yes. We botH also found ourselves facing
                    the dismantling of our previous bands Race the Flux and Ka tet and decided,
                    on a whim to have a no holes bash at making a tune, not expecting the idea to go any
                    further. That effort became the first track on the EP and the start of something
                    wonderful’.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Was it important to do the project to tie closely to the visuals?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Joe: ‘I think so anyway, we wanted to have a video for the full EP and it needed
                    to be reflective of the lunacy of some of the parts so we landed with what we
                    have now. It's kind of trance Inducing much like some of the stuff we
                    were at while writing.''
                </p>
                <p> Tomás: ‘I think we made efforts to preserve the spirit of that night
                    as we moved forward onto the rest of the EP and then on into the visuals.
                    It was a night of Darkness, friendship and devilment and the free way
                    in which it was produced has set a precedent that has allowed us
                    to continue like that... as HFS
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is number 1? does that mean there is more to come?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joe: ‘Yes its most definitely part one of many. We won’t wait so long
                    after writing to release the next one though.’
                </p>

                <p> As a first Ep/presentation it shows everything the two friends are
                    capable of, a dark mix of electro pop blended together with
                    Tomás’s effortless instantly recognisable vocals and Joe’s skilful guitar work,
                    all wrapped together in a trippy delicious visual and audio package.
                    This is a fantastic project put together by two of Galway/Mayo’s best;
                    If they can capture this as a live show, then I look forward to seeing how
                    this will be brought to a stage.

                <P>
                    Recorded and produced for Umbrella records in Mariachi studio’s by Joseph
                    Padfield.
