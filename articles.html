    The tough thing about having such open access to millions of artists
    everyday through streaming platforms such as Spotify, Deezer and Apple is that
    it can lead to stagnation in your listening choices. with the same few bands repeated
    over and over. Fear not we here at A Modern Movement have scoured the west
    coast ofIreland and have found some damn good musicians for you.
<p>
    Heres our Top 5

<h2>Galway</h2>
<h3>Derek Ellard & The Future Business Model</h3>
<img src="./images/D-E.jpg" alt="Derek-Ellard-Galway" style="width: 500px; height: auto;" />
<p>
    Derek Ellard – Something I have always thought makes a special artist is their ability
    to not stay in one lane, to not hold themselves to one specific style, to experiment,
    and to find their own sound, whether that be punk, country, folk, whatever.
    In the years I’ve been watching Derek Ellard as a musician he has not stopped in
    doing just that. Be it in his early days of playing in Galway.
    Sadly I missed his post hardcore days of Set On Black. Or in his days
    just utilising a loop pedal, guitar and voice, through to his first released EP
    ‘Candour’ in 2014, right up to now with his full band ‘… and The Future Business Model'
    he has kept approaching music as a challenge, something to conquer and overcome.
    It is this, almost need, within him to push himself on every new release and
    find something different, whether that be in the style of the track or the
    themes he addresses. Listening to his most recent releases ‘Wine Shake’
    ‘Understandably Forgivable’ and his final release of 2020 ‘Heavy Metals’
    They show an artist willing to try and explore every part of the
    musical process, whilst not being afraid to put his own darker parts on show.
    To see that in an artist such
    as Derek, the capacity to delve into such parts and put it all out there;
    whilst experimenting with musical styles, With an EP due early in the year.
    It all comes together to show why he is an artist to keep an eye
    on for 2021.

<h2>Galway</h2>
<h3> Slyrydes</h3>
<img src="./images/S-G.jpg" alt="Slyrydes-Couch-Galway" style="width: 600px; Height: Auto;" />

<p> Slyrydes- Exploding back, originally formed in 2015, onto the scene in Galway in 2019,
    Slyrydes quickly established themselves as the band to see, with visceral live shows
    and a perfect blendof heavy guitars and screaming vocals, post punk done perfectly punky.
    It’s this whirling dervish of Eoin Reilly’s thumping bass and Mark Comer scratchy
    and large guitar lines, built on top of Marc Raftery’s timely and hypnotically
    repeating lyrics that make Slyrydes sound distinct. It is also Mark Raftery’s
    ability to get honest about himself and to tap into a theme inside his lyrics,
    from Mental Health, on ‘Mental Health’, relationship breakdowns on ‘Point of View’
    to feelings of self-esteem and depression on ‘I Claim to Be Intelligent’
    It is this, that is exciting about Slyrydes; their ability to be this honest and
    this open, in a market littered with Post Punk bands right now, Slyrydes are standing
    out with their capacity to hone into genuine issues felt around the country
    and put them across in a way that doesn’t feel pretentious and put on.
    Having just finished their first debut album,
    recorded and produced by Daniel Doherty at Darklands studio Dublin, 2021
    looks to be a good year for these guys.

<h2>Limerick</h2>
<h3>Van Panther</h3>
<img src="./images/V-P.jpg" alt="Van-Panther-Limerick-Sahnnon" style="width: 600px; Height: Auto;" />
<p>
    Van Panther – If you’ve listened to my radio show, read my reviews, or even,
    came to our last A Modern Movement live show featuring these guys.
    Then, you know exactly why I’ve put Van Panther in here. These guys can’t, and won’t,
    be put into a box musically.
    Frontman Kieran Ralph has put together a selection of tracks that range wildly from
    one end of the musical spectrum to another, with recent tracks
    ‘Home’ and ‘To Live and Die’ picking up where their last EP’s 2019’s ‘Overcast’
    and 2017’s ‘Café Van Hemel’ and its follow up ‘Hark’ left off, with big fat punchy
    guitar lines and expertly sonic synth lines, that could at any moment break into
    a waltz like breakdown. The music flits between emo rock, dark electro and back
    around to electro pop faster than sonic collecting rings, it brings with it a sense
    that in their music experimentation is key to what’s important; making the music
    happen. From their early work on Café Van Hemel’ to ‘Home’, in which they have
    managed to tune into everything from dark country, bhangra inspired electro soul,
    to Postal Service inspired synth pop, Van Panther will not be pigeon holed, and
    this is what makes them one of the most exciting bands in the country right now.

<h3>PX Music</h3>
<img src="./images/P-X.jpg" alt="PX-Music-Pumpkin" style="width: 600px; Height: Auto;" />
<p>
    PX Music – Ok so I’m cheating here a little bit, but when certain artists music is so
    intricately entwined with each other as the Hip Hop collective PX Music’s it’s better
    to put them together as a whole. Representing artists Hazey Haze, GavinDaVinci, and
    Citrus Fresh, with Producers AKIA, 40Hurtz, Liv3 and Mankky, to name a few. PX Music
    has been releasing some of the finest Hip Hop coming out of Ireland right now, with
    each artist having a clear and distinct take and style. Releases ‘Ise Mise’ and
    ‘Pignorant’ in 2020 find Hazey Haze tearing through the scene in a way that only he
    can; lyrically violently as he attacks each verse purposely, while rhyming about
    growing up in Limerick, while Citrus Fresh with his releases ‘Smile’ and
    'Early Days/Late Nights’ in 2019 and his most recent 2020 release ‘Operating System’
    find him taking a smoother more avant garde approach to Hip Hop, he has an innate
    ability of to get a bit more introspective by rhyming on lost loves and personal
    moments, with softer slower and even jazz inspired beats mixed deftly with well picked
    out samples ranging from a PlayStation start tone, to a Fatboy slim rip.
    While GavinDaVinci through his Release ‘Superscumbagmode’ and recent release
    ‘Council House’ finds a space somewhere between the two, with smart lyricism,
    darker themes and a biting wit. Though, it is not just their own work that shines,
    it’s their appearances and bars on each other’s work that stands out,
    throughout all the releases you’ll hear label mates appearing, and throwing down
    a quick 16 bars, what shines is the comraderies built over the music and connection
    of hip hop that has brought these guys together, something that is evident in their
    live shows, and live streams over the last few months in Dolans.
    PX Music are aforce to be reckoned with in the Irish music scene.

<h2>Cork</h>
    <h3>The Last Vinci</h3>
    <img src="./images/T-L-V.jpg" alt="The-Last-Vinci-Purple" style="width: 600px; Height: Auto;" />
    <p>
        The Last Vinci - ‘The World, Enda Kenny, The Devil, The Vegans and all the Millennials
        Shit’; firstly let’s give some credit alone to that title, this EP released in 2019
        should be number one on your playlist if you are after chunky grungy guitar hooks and
        a big sound, The Last Vinci are keeping that grungy alternative stoner rock sound
        alive with force. Hailing from Cork and led by front man Alex Vinci, member of
        Order of the Mess and manager for Dublin two piece BiCurious, The Last Vinci are
        unique in a sea of bands in this category for their huge live sound and how it is
        captured almost perfectly in audio form, this is a band who know how play LOUD.
        It would be easy to make the QOTSA comparisons but there is something a little darker
        about The Last Vinci sound, that’s enticing. If the comparisons are to be made;
        it’s to Greece’s 1000 Mods,the sound is a little bit more European, which makes
        sense considering Alex’s Italian roots. As much as I love listening to this band,
        it is their live show that makes them important to me, it is not to be missed;
        making me miss live shows even more now. They attack a stage and space like no other band,
        and once we can get back to live shows I highly recommend seeing them as soon
        as possible.
